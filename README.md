# Enigma
An encryption project loosely based on the Enigma Machine

## Synopsis

This project was designed using the Enigma encryption machine as a rough template. Using a series of Rotors, a dynamic substitution cypher is applied to produce encrypted messages. Messages produced by this program can also be decrypted to reproduce the original plaintext message. Messages may be read from .html or .txt files and can be written to the same formats.

## Motivation

This project was built for a course on Object Oriented Programming at Manchester Community College. Release 1.0 represents the version submitted for final grading. The spec for the program as provided by the instructor:

> Note the following: All Cyphers must have the following abilities. 
> --------------
> 1. Read in a .txt file from a machine, which will be provided and encrypt same into a HTML file format where there are no more than 5 characters
>     to a line. This block format is easy to check and really easy to build. 
> 2. Each Cyphier must be able to take that HTML document and decrypt it into a format that rebuilds the original text file. 
> 3. All programs should have a instruction screen associated with it, so that the user can use the cypier even if the programmer is not there. 
> 4. For purposes of this class you should have the Log file working, just, in case something goes wrong. 
> 5. All programs should have a welcome screen and any intermediate screens that you as a developer deem necessary. 
> 6. If the program is written in Java, or Python it must be able to run in a native DOS world, which means outside of the development environments
>     and on most any machine selected to prove that it works. 
> 7. Be prepared to answer any questions. If you get stumped by the user, then it is not a good thing. 

## Installation

Please see the Release Notes for a given release for instructions on how to download and install this project. Generally, a .zip file will be provided with the compiled program which can be extracted and run on your local machine. A Java Runtime Environment is packaged with the program in case you don't have an up-to-date copy of Java installed. The program is designed to be portable and intended to run from a thumb drive, so there is no utility provided to install it on any particular OS.
